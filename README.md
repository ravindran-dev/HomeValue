## House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various features using a dataset (like that from Kaggle). The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `House Price Prediction.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with the full code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAVINDRAN-S/Linear-Regression-Project.git
cd house-price-prediction
```
### 2. Set Up Environment
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3.Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Launch Notebook
```bash

jupyter notebook
```
Open House Price Prediction.ipynb in your browser and run the cells.


## Sample Results
- RMSE: ~21,000

- R² Score: 0.65 (on test data)
(Based on current model configuration)
